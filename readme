SecretMessageApp is a simple desktop application that takes in a text
message or file and converts it into a mess of binary, or vice
versa. It is a rather simple side project inspired by the encryption
technology often showcased in sci-fi and spy thriller
movies (though, of course, with a mere fraction of the complexity). It
 goes without saying, but this application is not intended to be used
 seriously (i.e. do not store sensitive information, like passwords,
 usernames, etc).

The application was built using OpenJDK 17 and JavaFX 17, utilizing
the Maven framework to assist with app development and deployment.

There are several uses for the app:

A) Encode a message using the given input box.
1. On the application, type in the message you desire. For example,
type in, "Hello, World!"
2. Click the "Encode" button near the bottom of the application. It
should create a pop-up window that has the message in nonsense
binary. The text is inside a selectable text box, so you can copy and
paste it for your own benefit. If you typed in "Hello, World!", the
output should be: "0110111 0011010 0010011 0010011 0010000 010011
011111 0101000 0010000 0001101 0010011 0011011 011110 ".

B) Decode a message using the given input box.
1. Take any of the results from Part A (i.e. "0110111 0011010 0010011
0010011 0010000 010011 011111 0101000 0010000 0001101 0010011 0011011
011110 ") and type or paste it into the text box.
2. Click the "Decode" button near the bottom of the application. It
should create a pop-up window that has a readable message. The text
is inside a selectable text box, so you can copy and paste it for
your own benefit. The example in Step 1 should now become, "Hello,
World!".

C) Encode a message using a text file.
0. Have a text file filled with text (i.e. make a "hello_world.txt"
 file with the words "Hello, World!".
1. Click the "Encode File" button on the bottom of the application.
2. A file dialog will open, letting you choose a .txt file. Press
"Open".
3. A pop-up window should appear informing you that a save dialog will
 open. Click "OK".
4. A file dialog will open again, allowing you to save to a text file.
 While technically it is possible to save as a different file, it is
 recommended to simply use a .txt file extension (i.e. "encoded.txt").
5. Press "Save"
6. Open the file you just encoded in your computer (i.e. "encoded
.txt"). The contents should be only 0's and 1's.

D) Decode a message using a text file.
0. Ensure that there is an encoded text file you had previously made
(i.e. "encoded.txt" from Part C).
1. Click the "Decode File" button on the bottom of the application.
2. A file dialog will open, letting you choose a .txt file. Press
"Open".
3. A pop-up window should appear informing you that a save dialog will
 open. Click "OK".
4. A file dialog will open again, allowing you to save to a text file.
 While technically it is possible to save as a different file, it is
 recommended to simply use a .txt file extension (i.e. "decoded.txt").
5. Press "Save".
6. Open the file you just saved on your computer. If you followed the
example, you should get, "Hello, World!".

NOTES:
1. As stated above, this program is NOT intended for serious use (i.e.
 saving passwords, usernames, etc). DO NOT SAVE SENSITIVE INFORMATION
 WITH THIS PROGRAM. Use the program for fun!
2. When decoding a message with the text box, please ensure only 0's
and 1's are in the text area (i.e. do not put "" or letters in the
text box when decoding). Doing so may lead to unexpected results.
